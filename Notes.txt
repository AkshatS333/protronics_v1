6.33 - in gitignore file remove / from modules since we want all node modules present in root or in front end or anywhere else.

     - also mention .env since we will be needing these files


6.37 - we should initialize a git repository in the root

6.52 - run git init that will initialize git repository
        go in github and create new repository
        git add .
        git commit -m "initial commit"

        and then 3 commands of from newly created gitub repository is copied and pasted
