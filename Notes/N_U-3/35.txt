- addDecimals function from cartSlice.js are put in a separate file

- in frontend in src folder we will create a folder called utils
    in utils create a file called cartUtils.js

- in cartUtils.js implement the same addDecimals function


- from cartSlice.js we pick
    different calculations and them in cartUtils.js
    in cartUtils one new function is made for different calculations from cartSlice


- at this point we can clear our cart from local storage as we are not having an explicit feature
