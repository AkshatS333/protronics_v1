- we will be using mongodb atlas which is a cloud  version .
    no need to install mongo on local machine


- setup mongodb atlas and create database
    connect -> connect your application->copy the connection string

    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://akshat123:<password>@cluster0.hrzidjp.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    add this to .env

    added pwd and updated database name to protronics

    add collection in mongodb site with connection name: protronics and collection as: products

    created example.env for sample for other users if they access github in root directory as .env is not pushed 
    to github
