- we want to fetch our products from react application till now we are just bringing in the javascript

- in frontend 
    npm i axios

- fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/products')
  fetch('/api/products')  rest of it will be taken care by proxy
  if in development then localhost 5000 and in production the deployed site



- in package.json 
     "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
     in development mode this proxy will be used
     so even writing '/api/products' will work in dev mode as it automatically adds proxy in front of it.




- did changes in HomeScreen.js to fetch data from backend
  useEffect and useState hooks are imported

- also same type of changes must be applied in ProductScreen.js


- now the data is coming from the backend, but on backend the data exists in form of file only
  we want it to comer from server
  so we can delete products.js from the frontend folder instead we are using products.js that is 
  present in backend



- With axios, you can make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other types of requests to your backend server or external APIs
