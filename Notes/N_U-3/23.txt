- in this module we will use postman 

- create workspace in postman
    create environment there and add variable: baseURL and initial value: http://localhost:5000/api
    save it
    at upper right choose the protronics environment


- then create API in postman


- if we want to make request it should be in collection
    we should have 3 collection:
    product
    orders 
    users



- create new collection as products and add new request in it ie Get all requests
    in URL enter {{baseURL}}/products
    and then send

    here the returned products do not have ids because we are still fetching from the file
    and not the database
