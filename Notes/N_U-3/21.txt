- in we will seed some data
    In the context of building web applications, "seeding the data" refers to the process of initially populating
    a database or data store with some predefined data. 
    It is commonly done during the setup or initialization phase of an application.

    like adding some dummy data to the database



- for seeding the data we will be using data-> products.js, and for that reason whenever we insert data in any database
    it automatically assingns an id to it.
    so from products.js we can delete the _id part




- in backend-> data --> users.js. there we will create our dummy users


- but when we create users we need to store their passwords. and those passowords should be encypted
    for encryption we will be using a package called Bcrypt 
    to install bcrypt : npm i bcryptjs    in root directory





- import bcrypt from bcryptjs in users.js


- entered dummy users in users.js
