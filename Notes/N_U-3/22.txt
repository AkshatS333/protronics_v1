- to have colors in terminal/ console we can install a package  
     npm i colors in root directory



- in backend we will create a file seeder.js, this will the script we will
    run to seed all of our data



- When you call dotenv.config(), it reads the .env file and sets
    the environment variables for the current process. This 
    allows your application to access these values using process.
    env.VARIABLE_NAME throughout the codebase.



- process.exit() terminates the process with a default exit code of 0 (successful termination).
- process.exit(1) terminates the process with an exit code of 1 (indicating a generic or unspecified error).


- in seeder.js we wrote code for importData and destroyData 
    now we need to find a way to run them when the script's run

    we can do this by providing extra command line argument and 
    having some conditions in code for running different functions.



- to run seeder with command line and without command line argument 
    we will create a script in package.json

    npm run data:import for running import
    npm run data:destroy for running destroy function
