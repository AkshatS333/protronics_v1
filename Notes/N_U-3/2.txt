- npm init in root folder
    entry point : server.js
    license: MIT

- to follow es module syntax like 
    import something rather than require something

    to do this mention in package.json 
    "type": "module"


- entry point will be a folder called backend in root directory
    create server.js in backend folder


- also one change in package.json
    "test": "node backend/server.js"



- npm i express in root directory


- wrote code in server.js

- copy the product.js in src and copy it to data folder in backend folder


- import products in server.js
    since we are using es module we need to put .js at the end of file while importing
    import products from './data/products.js';




- we will do get request in server.js for /api/products
    here we are serving all the products



- for creating a route for single project 
    '/api/products/:id'
    that function loops through all the products and compares the _id (which is inherent characteristic)
    with the req.params.id(which we received through the link)
