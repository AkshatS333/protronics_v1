- here we will create a controller for each route and use that controller function

- in backend create new folder called controllers and in that a file called productController.js

- in productRoutes.js we dont need asyncHandler and Product models
    but we imported these to productController.js


- so basically we cleaned up the code in produtRoutes.js    and put all the logic
    in productController.js
