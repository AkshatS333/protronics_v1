- install nodemon so that server will start automatically if any change occurs

- install concurrently, as our frontend is on port 3000 while backend server on port 5000
    so we will be needing different terminals to start them
    using concurrently will allow single command to run both frontend and backend


- in root directory 
    npm i -D nodemon concurrently



- making some changes in package.json to define scripts to run different things
    server for running nodemon
    client for starting frontend port
    dev for running both
