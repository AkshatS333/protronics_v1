- in this module we will create component of rating

- create rating.js in component folder

- the rating function in Rating.js will have two parameters as input
    the value( that will indicate the stars) and text (that is some text
    like 2 reviews or 3 reviews )



- for showing star we have specific components
    we use { value >=1 } as if condition
    if value >=1 then full star 
    else if value >= 0.5 then half star
    else empty star

    Similarly for 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th star. accordingly values in conditions are changing


    in last span is used to display text
    in that too if text == NULL, it wont be displayed
    and if it exists then text will be displayed



- import rating in Product.js
    implement Rating above product.price
    also we can correlate with input parameters at Rating.js here that Rating function taking value and text
    as the input parameter


- here one issue is coming if the name of one product is coming in 
    one line and for other product it is coming in 2 lines then the sizes 
    of card are varying

    for it we have a css class that employs two properties:

        white space: nowrap 
        means if there is extra text it will not wrap on second line either
        it will hide in boundaries of the container or a scroll bar can component

        text-overflow : ellipsis this property allows to have (...) dots if the 
        text overflows and do not go to second line. 
        if the user hovers all the content is visible


    so we just have to apply css class in Product component and add
    this class there
